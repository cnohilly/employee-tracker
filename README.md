# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Description

This project was to create a Command Line Interface (CLI) with a database using Node and the packages Inquirer (version 8.2.4) and mysql2. The code was written to be modular, separating the different queries to be made into different javascript files and accessing them using promises and then statements. The user has the ability to edit most if not all the data of the database through the CLI and appropriate menus are presented to the user to input data for new entries or lists are presented to choose what changes to make.
